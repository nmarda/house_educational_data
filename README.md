# house_educational_data
This repository contains educational attainment data for the House of Representatives

Over the next few days, I intend to:
- Create one consolidated CSV file with all of the data in a standardized manner
- Write Python script to systematically parse through the data (instead of code snippets spread out across .py files)
- Add features to that Python script to graph data within the same code
- Upload the [number].txt files necessary to run webscrape.py
