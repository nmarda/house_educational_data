# house_educational_data
This repository contains educational attainment data for the House of Representatives

From the command line, run `python3 combine.py`. This will print out the most updated statistics on the educational data for the 107th to 115th Congress, inclusive.

The current version of the data is found in the files bio_combined.csv and bios114_115_116.csv. The other files are for the python scripts to function properly.

Over the next few days, I intend to:
- Create one consolidated CSV file with all of the data in a standardized manner
- Write Python script to systematically parse through the data (instead of code snippets spread out across .py files)
- Add features to that Python script to graph data within the script mentioned above
- Upload the [number].txt files necessary to run webscrape.py
