# house_educational_data
This repository contains educational attainment data for the House of Representatives

The current version of the data is found in the files bio_combined.csv and bios114_115_116.csv. The other files are for the python scripts to function properly.

Over the next few days, I intend to:
- Create one consolidated CSV file with all of the data in a standardized manner
- Write Python script to systematically parse through the data (instead of code snippets spread out across .py files)
- Add features to that Python script to graph data within the script mentioned above
- Upload the [number].txt files necessary to run webscrape.py
- Go through each Congress and add missing data + remove members from special elections (they are mostly removed right now, but some files don't have 435 entries)
- Add details on how to use the programs to the README file
